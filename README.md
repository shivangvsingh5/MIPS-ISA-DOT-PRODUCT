# MIPS-ISA-Dot-Product

MIPS ISA Dot Product with Forward Chaining facility

The main objective of this project is the learn the designing and implementation of a program which utilizes MIPS ISA along with Dot Product program which also uses Forward Chaining. So, starting with the abstract we can try to understand how the process works in MIPS ISA program when we use the feature of forward chaining into it.
