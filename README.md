# MIPS-ISA-Dot-Product

The main objective of this project is the learn the designing and implementation of a program which utilizes MIPS ISA along with Dot Product program which also uses **Forward Chaining**. So, starting with the abstract we can try to understand how the process works in MIPS ISA program when we use the feature of forward chaining into it. Present era of SOCâ€™s contains analog, digital and mixed signal components housing all on the same chip. In such complex environment, a processor plays a vital and vivid role. As we can notice that the computer architecture industry is shrinking at a rapid rate to sub-micrometer technology node, that leads to a huge scope and space for undesirable hazards in processors. And these hazards are extremely dangerous and can ultimately lead to disturbances in area, power and timing which can deviate requirements from the standard desired qualities. 

Among multiple types of RISC CPU architecture, **MIPS** is one of the most successful microprocessor and we are focused on improving its performance in this project through Verilog code by using Dot Product and Forward Chaining mechanism.
